<li>Although <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> will always strive for on-time performance some unpredictable factors (bad traffic accidents, weather, children that are late, etc.) may cause delays on occasion. <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> will do our best to be on-time and provide a phone call to the place of pick-up/drop-off if the delay is more than 10 minutes.
<li>Any time that your child will not require transportation as scheduled, all ride cancellations must be made by 7pm the previous business day to avoid being charged. <b>For each failure to provide this notification, there will be a $10.00 service charge on the following month's invoice.</b>
<li>All AGREEMENT terminations are subject to a two-week (10 business days) written notice by the parent/legal guardian authorized to make changes.  This notice can be given to the driver or mailed to the office.  Upon receipt of such notification, the services will cease at requested date of time.
<li><b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> will observe the same holidays and in-service days as individual schools in the area.

For the safety of the children, <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> will not operate in dangerous driving conditions. 
<li>All services are prepaid and nonrefundable. We cannot provide refunds or credit for absences, cancellations, holidays, school breaks, sick days, expulsions or suspensions. All fees are prepaid and non-refundable.
<li>Our cost-effective rates are based on group transportation. We will do our utmost to provide reasonable drive times, but our vans are very busy during the hours of 6am-9am & 3pm-7pm.  Drive times will range from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on your location. All pickup and drop off times are estimates and subject to vary as our schedules change.
<li>Due to consideration for all our customers, maximum wait time at each stop is two minutes. Please have rider ready and waiting OUTSIDE for our van to ensure on-time arrival at school/activity. We will depart <b>AFTER SOUNDING HORN ONCE.</b>
<li>At no time will <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> leave the vehicle unattended.  All children must have an authorized authority to receive them at time of drop-off.
<li>If for some reason, <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> fails to pick up your child due to an unplanned or emergency situation, you will be contacted and then credited with that absence on your next statement. If we are unable to continue to provide transportation for any reason, you will receive notice 10 business days prior to any change being implemented.
<li>If your child rides with the <b>Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC</b> more times than this AGREEMENT specified, you will be billed for the additional trips at the applicable rates. 
<li><font color="red"><b>If it becomes necessary to enforce any of the payment provisions of this AGREEMENT, then the prevailing party will recover all reasonable attorney fees and court costs from the non-prevailing party. In the event that the client defaults in the payment of fees due under the terms of this AGREEMENT for a period that exceeds 30 days, subsequently, the due dates of all payments may be accelerated by Kids Door 2 Door Service, LLC and all remaining payments due under the AGREEMENT will be due and payable immediately.</b></font>
