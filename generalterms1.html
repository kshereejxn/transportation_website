<li>Any time that your child will not require transportation as scheduled, all ride cancellations must be made by 7pm the previous business day to avoid being charged. <b>For each failure to provide this notification, there will be a $10.00 service charge on the following month's invoice.</b>
<li>All AGREEMENT terminations are subject to a two-week (10 business days) written notice by the parent/legal guardian authorized to make changes.  This notice can be given to the driver or mailed to the office.  Upon receipt of such notification, the services will cease at requested date of time.

<li>All services are prepaid and nonrefundable. We cannot provide refunds or credit for absences, cancellations, holidays, school breaks, sick days, expulsions or suspensions. All fees are prepaid and non-refundable.
